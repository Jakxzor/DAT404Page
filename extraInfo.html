  <p class="infoContent">My name is Jack Vearncombe, I am currently a 20 year old <br>student studying Digital
       Media Design at Plymouth University. <br>At first I was studying Computer Science, but I changed
      as <br>I was much more interested in the design side of computing <br>rather than pure coding and software design.

  <p class="infoContent2">I prefer the hands on modules where we get to interact with computers or tools to make items,
    It's why I changed courses in the first place. I love designing logos and editing pictures in photoshop, its something
    a good friend taught me how to do in college. Before then I had no clue about design but now i feel i'm not too bad.
    I haven't got a clear-cut profession that i'd like to go into after this. Perhaps web design or graphic design as i feel i'm best at that.
