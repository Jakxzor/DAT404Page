  <p class="gameTitle"> College Mine Game</p>
  <p class="gameDescription">This is a game I made in college in my second year, it is made using greenfoot. In incorporates the ability to
    <br>shoot using the left mouse button, move with the keyboard controls which are W and S, it can't move side to side but it does move
    <br> towards where the mouse is, making it easier to play the game, so you also aim with the mouse too, amongst many other mechanics.
    <br>I am quite proud of it and will one day when I have time, improve on the design. <br></p>

  <p class="gameTitle"> Tekno Town</p>
  <p class="gameDescription">This was a game I was in the middle of making during my second year in computing. <br>We were made to build an
    environment based on a particular theme.<br> As i'm a big cyberpunk fan i decided to go with that type of theme, taking ideas
    from films like Blade Runner. Making my own textures using examples from that. It also had a coin collection mechanic.<br></p>
