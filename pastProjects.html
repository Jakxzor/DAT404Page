    <p class="gameTitle"> Old Project Site</p>
    <p class="gameDescription">This was a site I made in computing that displayed a few of the things we had done for our assignments.
    At the time I thought it looked well desigend but now i know more about design I can really see how its just too flat . The colours are
  okay but it doesnt fit with the game design theme, just like the stock image at the top.</p>

  <div class="gameInfo2">
    <p class="gameTitle"> Coffee Game</p>
    <p class="gameDescription">This was a project about brainstorming design ideas. We were given a topic and told to design layouts
    for how the game might look. I chose a coffee based game that would work along the lines of "Cooking Mama", where the user is given
  a type of coffee to make and they use buttons on screen to make that coffee, getting points for speed and accuracy.</p>
