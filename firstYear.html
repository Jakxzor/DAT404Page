    <p class="gameTitle"> First Project</p>
    <p class="gameDescription"> Our first project was in groups, we had to think of an object or idea, get a picture of it, create a poster on it.
    Then we would have to talk about how it can be looked at, what in means to people. How differently it can be interpretted. In our case we took
  a picture of the lighthouse in plymouth and also made a custom replica of the lighthouse via 3D printing.</p>

  <div class="gameInfo2">
    <p class="gameTitle"> Video/Sound</p>
    <p class="gameDescription">Our next project was to make a video on technology and talk about its history and what people use it for, as well as how it
    could change in the future. I picked mobile phones and spoke about its roots, where it could go in the future and how people are connected now, compared
  to how connected people wer before mobile phones</p>

  <div class="gameInfo">
    <p class="gameTitle"> Arduino</p>
    <p class="gameDescription">We have worked with arduino boards, using them to manipulate video via physical interaction. Ours in particular
    was a box that was laser printed which held the board. The board then had an accelerometer which controlled contrast on hue, it also was touch sensitive
  as well as changing the appearance of a video on screen by twisting an input.</p>
